**50 Projects in 50 Days - HTML/CSS, and JavaScript**

Welcome to the 50 Projects in 50 Days challenge! In this challenge, you'll be creating 50 different web projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is designed to help you improve your front-end development skills, experiment with different techniques, and build a strong foundation in web development.

**How It Works**

Duration: 50 days
Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For each day of the challenge, you will create a new web project from scratch using the specified technologies. Each project will have its own folder containing the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any assets) to complete the project. You'll also find a README.md file within each project folder that explains the project's purpose, features, and potentially offers some tips on how to approach it.
